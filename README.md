NATO Phonetic Alphabet Generator

This is a Python script that generates the NATO phonetic alphabet representation for a given word. The NATO phonetic alphabet is a set of standardized words used to spell out letters and numbers in a clear and unambiguous way. This script utilizes a CSV file containing the mapping between letters and their corresponding NATO phonetic codes.
Prerequisites

    Python 3.x
    pandas library

Installation

    Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
    Install the pandas library if it's not already installed. You can install it using the following command:

    pip install pandas

Usage

    Open a terminal or command prompt.
    Navigate to the directory where you saved the script.
    Run the script using the following command:

python nato_phonetic.py

The script will read the CSV file and create a dictionary (phonetic_dict) containing the mapping between letters and their NATO phonetic codes.
You will be prompted to enter a word.
After entering the word, the script will generate the NATO phonetic alphabet representation for each letter in the word.
